    <h2>My Journey </h2>
    <p>
        I didn’t start my journey in computer science — I actually come from an electronics background. 
    But while working on small projects, I got curious about how websites and apps work behind the scenes. 
    That curiosity pushed me into learning frontend first, and I built a few basic interfaces. 
    Over time, I realized I enjoyed the logic side more — connecting things, handling data, and making everything work smoothly. 
    That’s when I naturally shifted towards backend development. 
    
    Today, I work on real backend systems, APIs, and search features, and I genuinely enjoy solving problems on the server side. 
    Even though I didn’t come from a pure CS background, I’ve built my skills through projects, internships, and continuous learning — 
    and that’s what keeps me excited about backend development every day.
